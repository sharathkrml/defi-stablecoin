# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 42](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L42)

	```solidity
	contract DecentralizedStableCoin is ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 49](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L49)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 60](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 124](src/DSCEngine.sol#L124)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountCollateral);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 31](src/DSCEngine.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 29](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L29)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 104](src/DSCEngine.sol#L104)

	```solidity
	        i_dsc = DecentralizedStableCoin(dscAddress);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 122](src/DSCEngine.sol#L122)

	```solidity
	        s_collateralDeposited[msg.sender][tokenCollateralAddress] += amountCollateral;
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 142](src/DSCEngine.sol#L142)

	```solidity
	        s_DSCMinted[msg.sender] += amountDscToMint;
	```

</details>



## L-5: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 49](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L49)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 60](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-6: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event CollateralDeposited(address indexed user, address indexed token, uint256 amount);
	```

</details>



## L-7: The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 120](src/DSCEngine.sol#L120)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 139](src/DSCEngine.sol#L139)

	```solidity
	    function mintDsc(uint256 amountDscToMint) external moreThanZero(amountDscToMint) nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-8: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-9: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function
